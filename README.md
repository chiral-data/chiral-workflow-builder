# ðŸ§ª Computational Workflow Template

This repository provides a **template project** for building reproducible computational workflows using the software stack provided by **[Chiral]**.

It is designed to help researchers and developers quickly set up, run, and share computational workflows, e.g, chemistry or molecular simulation projects.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`0-planning/`**  
  Project planning materials, schedules, task lists, and notes for workflow development.

- **`1-env/`**  
  Environment configuration files (Conda `environment.yml`, Dockerfile, or Singularity definition).

- **`2-input/`**  
  Example workflows and demo input files.

- **`3-workflow/`**
  - Workflow and analysis scripts to run simulations or calculations and to carry on post-processing and analysis of simulation or calculation results.
  - Input files for workflows, including molecular structures, parameters, and configuration files.

- **`4-results/`**  
  Output data generated by workflows (trajectories, logs, plots, reports).

- **`5-docs/`**  
  Documentation, guidelines, and replication report templates.

- **`README.md`**  
  This file, containing an overview, setup instructions, guidelines etc.
